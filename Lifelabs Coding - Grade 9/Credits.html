<p class="testimony">"You really have to make sure that your video is base on the content that your making so that your 
  audience will watch your video more.<br>you really have to edit your video
   which that takes time and effort and very tiring,especially learning 
   how to upload stuffs and making scripts,<br>records just to make a whole video,
   and you really have to make the records clear as possible so that people can understand what your 
   talking.stressing at first but you'll get a hang with it,ever since we made our very first video many people
   have been watching it for the past weeks and were also gaining subscribers which make us happy about it and it's
    like our work was paid off,it was really fun making our channel as long our videos,it was really fun."

<p class="testimony">"This quarter's experience with life labs was both enjoyable and stressful. I learned a lot about coding,
   video creation, YouTube, and how to promote our channel on various social media platforms this quarter. This quarter allows us to hone our skills and 
   improve our video creation. It also boosts our confidence because our videos are shared on a variety of social media platforms, resulting in a large number of people 
   seeing our videos and hearing our voices. I find it enjoyable because we have fun while creating the video because we get creative, and we are pleased with the engagement results that
    we are receiving for each of our videos, as well as the feedback that we are receiving from our peers, Learning facilitators, and, most importantly, our target audiences.I learned about 
    SEO and other YouTube Video editing tools that could be used in our PBA so that other people could easily find our YouTube channel and help us increase engagement. I found it difficult from the 
    beginning of the video creation because, because it is a group activity, we should be able to collaborate and participate to others, so each of us must submit a video recording. I was hesitant at 
    first because I was shy, and especially when I discovered that we had to post it online and through our social media. Video recording took a long time because I don't have my own personal space and 
    anyone in my family can just invade my privacy and be extremely loud at times. I considered what others would say about my contribution because I plan to post it on facebook, where my relatives, friends, 
    and other peers will be able to see it. But I guess I could say I got over it or we got over it, because I know we were all a little nervous about doing the video at first. However, this experience 
    enhanced and improved our speaking skills, as well as boosted our self-esteem, which was extremely beneficial to us. This quarter has been a roller coaster ride for us; there are some activities that 
    are simple for us to complete, but there are also some difficult tasks. I believe that our group is fortunate, and that we are able to complete our tasks more efficiently because our leader properly 
    facilitates us. Our journey this quarter has been made easier by our facilitator, Xian, because he has facilitated us and delegated tasks, as well as made us understand what we are supposed to do, and 
    as a result, we have been able to complete all of our tasks and work as a group efficiently."

<p class="testimony">"My experience when we started to make our channel in Youtube, is at first, I had a hard time figuring out how to use the tools in Youtube, 
  how to edit videos, how to upload videos in Youtube and etc. While we were working for our first youtube video, I suddenly thought that it wasn‚Äôt that easy to be a youtuber. 
  First at all, you need to come up with an idea of how to make videos that viewers can have fun and enjoy. I also had difficulty with voice and video recording, sometimes it took 
  me 20 minutes to 1 hour to do it properly and clearly. And not only that, I also had a hard time with pageedit and lost my time management because of that especially and I'm just a beginner 
  in the field of editing. But these difficulties did not stop us from doing what we were supposed to do with my group. Then when we finally finish doing our videos and channel, And when we were 
  done making our video and channel, it entered my mind that being diligent, with time management, and with discipline would help us to accomplish our goals in life."

<p class="testimony">"My experiences when we started to make a channel in Youtube, is a bit hard and it‚Äôs exhausting at the same time. I know that this is only a start and I
   know that we will make progress everyday. I remembered that we need to read the script and record. I thought that it was gonna be easy as it looks, but I didn‚Äôt know that it was 
   quite hard since you need practice and timing. I had a hard time on audio recording and it took me about 30 minutes or an hour or maybe 2 hours. And not only that, I‚Äôve also figured 
   out how to use tools on Youtube, how to edit videos in a proper way, how to upload, etc. But editing is harder than it looks because you need to manage and make your audiences interested in our content."

<p class="testimony">"My experience this quarter is challenging since some of them are hard to understand since
   it's new for me to learn. But after a couple days i learned them just like making our youtube vid, Answering some 
   questions in the eg. It makes me happy that our progress is getting better and better just like our youtube channel. 
   Our first vid got a pretty good amount of views and we also gained a good amount of subscribers and our second video is still 
   gathering up some views. In this eg i experience to do some voice overs like explaining stuff in our vids, also im enjoying on how i learn on youtube productions"

<p class="testi">"Lifelabs this quarter was really fun and stressful at the same time for me. I am really 
  glad that I learned how to create and manage a YouTube channel. <br>The given tasks also helped me improve my video
   editing skills. It was also fun to create videos on a topic that I am rather fond about; VALORANT. <br>Doing voiceovers 
   was not really difficult for me as I have done them hundreds of times. Perhaps the most difficult part of this whole quarter
    was trying <br>to get things done on time. Making a YouTube video is a process that takes many steps.You need to create a script, 
    do voiceovers, edit the video, <br>and so much more. However, the sight of seeing your video and channel gain more views, likes and subscribers, 
    and just watching your overall <br>channel grow outweighs all these challenges for me."
